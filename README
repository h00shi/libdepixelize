# libdepixelize

This library will implement the algorithm described in the following paper:
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/

# License

This library is dual-licensed under GPLv2+ and LGPLv2.1+.

# Dependencies

This is a C++ library and it depends on the gdkmm and 2geom libraries.

If you are planning to build the binaries (default option), then you'll
also need popt.

All dependencies are chosen to give a smooth transition to Inkscape
source code, but libdepixelize will continue to be a separate project.

# Build

This library uses the CMake build system. To compile it, just run:

    cmake source-dir
    make

Make sure you have the dependencies installed.
